# TELOS

## DOCUMENT PURPOSE

This document captures the TELOS method of articulating a person's personal context so that they, and AI, can better understand them and help them improve. Pay attention to the items and the concepts here, and especially on how they work together.

The conceptual path is Problems -> Mission -> (Narratives) -> Goals -> Challenges -> Strategies —> Projects -> Journal. This means that any project you're doing can be mapped all the way back up to the problem(s) you're trying to solve. This gives you transparency and explainability in everything you're doing so you don't end up busy for days/months/years without being able to remember why you're doing what you're doing.

Other sections that aren't those core sections are additional context to support them.

## HISTORY

- I grew up in the Eugene, OR area
- I went to Winston Churchill High School, where I was bullied a decent amount
- Elementary and Middlle School is where I met my 2 life-long friends, Oliver and Toby, who are still my friends today

## PROBLEMS

- P1: Not enough people understand how to safely scan QR codes
- P2: Not enough college students understand or care about their finances and starting early
- P3: Many first-time startup founders reach a bottleneck of knowledge management when they grow a team
- P4: Small companies find it hard to create and maintain Written Information Security Plans (WISP) for cybersecurity compliance

## MISSION

- M1: Create and promote a mobile app for safely scanning QR codes
- M2: Start a newsletter that shares tips and tricks to college students for becoming financially smarter
- M3: Make a SaaS product tailored to first-time founders that makes it easy and scalable to show their ways to newcomers
- M4: Create a system at my part-time job as a compliance consultant that takes risk input from threats and compliance sources

## NARRATIVES

- N1: I think QR Codes are scalable and easy to use, but they're currently extremely insecure, so I'm building an app and a standard that promotes safe QR scanning
 
## GOALS

- G1: Get at least 100,000 downloads of Safe-Scan by December 2025
- G2: Get a girlfriend through my charisma based on intelligence and insights by December 2025
- G3: Travel to all regions of the world

## CHALLENGES

- C1: I'm doing software development for the first time, so I'm acquiring the knowledge as I make Safe-Scan
- C2: I'm having trouble building the UI/UX for SOSS
- C3: I'm an an over-thinker, so it's difficult to stay engaged in conversations, especially intimate

## THINGS I'VE BEEN WRONG ABOUT

- Thought I wanted to have money and fame, but I discovered that I really want recognition
- I thought that to achieve what I want requires isolation from friends and pleasure, but then I won't be able to share insights to my community

## IDEAS

- I1: I have three core systems of desires: Life System, Work System, and Family System
- I2: Each core system includes Meanings, Principles, and Values
    - I1a: Meaning (Purpose + Vision) - How I am defined through Purpose and Vision, which influences the Principles.
    - I1b: Principles (Mission) - These are the external natural laws that determine the Mission and the consequences of my Values.
    - I1c: Values (Pillars) - Internal and subjective definitions of how I operate (which govern my behavior). They are a factory that manufactures: 
        -I1c1: Intelligence (Raw Materials) - Includes Blog/Book/YouTube/Podcast notes + Wisdom
		-I1c2: Objectives, Strategies, and Tactics (Final Products) - Represent the Goals, Plans (mapped to each goal), and Schedules (fulfill the goal by executing the intelligence)

## PREDICTIONS

- Legacy economic models predict that we are in a secular crisis and a crash is inevitable. But I think tech is doing two things:
    - Social media is making the Gen Z audience care more about their appearance than exchanging wisdom from their caretakers. Therefore they are spending more money.
    - The economic freedom that tech provides is putting more wealth in the economy to spend on appearance, and pump the economy more

## BEST BOOKS

## WISDOM

- At the end of high school, we have a fork in the road
    - The low-risk, medium-reward average route
    - The high-risk, high-reward, extraordinary route
- When you feel severely depressed (and you can’t Transurf), it means a change in either risk or reward must happen. Therefore, your body gets sick in order to creatively think of a different way to approach the problem successfully.
    - Give your mind some time to discover how to adjust the risk AND reward (usually one side changes your circumstances, and the other embraces it)
- It would be best if you found the balance between strivings and self-acceptance (through affect (Transurfing) and balanced actions (Sabbaticals))

## TRAUMAS

- Epilepsy during preschool and the first two years of elementary school at Mohawk
- Starting thrid grade at Edison was a win because I no longer had epilepsy, but I was very behind acedemically and socially (I took pride in annoying people) 
- When I went to Kennedy Middle School, I caught up academically, but I was still far behind socially. I continued my annoying behavior to a new friend group
- By the time I made it to Winston Churchill High School, I had the same friend group, so people noticed and took advantage of my social awkwardness
- Post high-school, I isolated myself because I was done being bullied. But after a few years I was really lonely that it affected my focus
- During college, the same theme is present of not feeling good enough because I feel like I still haven't figured out my social life
